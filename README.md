<h1>Project Title: CareerConnect</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
The objective of this project is to provide a career services platform where students (job seekers) can post and update their portfolios and employers can post job openings. This platform will help both job seekers and employers to shortlist potential job and employee respectively. It will also help employers find specific candidates as per their requirements and job seekers to tailor their profile as per the market. All that is required is a PC or mobile device with internet access to use the website.

<h2>Note:</h2>
This project is intended to help you gain experience in software project management skills. You will be using GitHub for distributed version control and access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis to support the project management process. The goal is to deliver a compelling middle-fidelity prototype that could serve as the basis for defining a real product, not a marketable product.
