This project is intended to help you gain experience in software project management skills. You will be using GitHub for distributed version control and access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis to support the project management process. The goal is to deliver a compelling middle-fidelity prototype that could serve as the basis for defining a real product, not a marketable product.
